# Lothbrok
Lothbrok is a cross-platform 2D game about vikings, loot and fighting. It's written in Java, with the libGDX framework, so it runs on PC/Mac/Linux, Android and iOS.
It was my final project for my BSc in Computer Science at ELTE, Budapest.

You can jump and fight, but gold falls out of your treasure chest with every action, so be careful! Reach the end of the level with as much gold as possible.
